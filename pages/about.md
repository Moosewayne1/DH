## About the Collection

This study was done to see if there is a correlation between political alignment and hate crime statistics. I chose this project because the amount of political radicalizatin in the U.S. has dramatically increased over the last 10 years, and I wanted to see how often that political radicalization turns into violence by tracking hate crime data. This collection was created to provide samples from hate crime cases from 2014-2024. The collection contains the following:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- Images related to previous hate crime cases such as mugshots and vandalism related to hate crimes.


## The Research Process

### Tracking Hate Crime Statistics

The first element of this project was to check CDE data to see the trends of hate crimes throughout the years. I chose Texas because as a native Texan (who grew up in Houston, one of the most diverse cities in Texas), I am naturally curious about the trends in my home state, as there are various perspectives that are represented there.

As you can see, hate crime data has risen significantly compared to the levels reported in 2014.

I then proceeded to categorize the different types of hate crimes committed in that timespan as well

### Tracking Political Leanings in Texas

The nest step was to track voter statistics in the state of Texas for both 2016, the first Trump Presidency, and 2020, the Biden Presidency. I broke down the election results into the percentage of votes each candidate received in both elections.
